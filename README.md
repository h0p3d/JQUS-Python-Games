# JQUS-Python-Games
Instructions and starter code to develop three fun python games. Originally developed to teach 8th graders python.

I developed these games in January 2020 as part of my student teaching program. 
Students had learned about 
-python variables
- data types (int, float, string, list and boolean)
- if statements
- while loops
- turtle commands - goto, penup, pendown, color, forward, right, setheading

Using these commands, instructions, and a series of walkthrough videos they completed the starter code to make 
fun python games and then answered design reflection questions as part of the IB MYP design curriculum.

Each game has starter code and an instructions packet which links to the video.
